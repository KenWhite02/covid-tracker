## Project Title

Covid-19 Tracker <br/>

As cases are still on the rise, as a programmer I built a Covid tracker to keep you up to date on the latest stats of the virus.

## Technologies Used

This project was initialized using `React Js.`

I consumed the `disease.sh` api and fetched data which was used in compiling the statistics.

`Material UI` was mainly used for the design of this project.

Dependencies such as `chart-js` was used in displaying the Worlwide New Cases Graph.

`React Leaflet` was used in displaying the world map.
